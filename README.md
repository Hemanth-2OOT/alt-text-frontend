# Alt-Text Frontend

A **Next.js-based web application** designed to showcase the [Alt-Text PyPI Package](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/alt-text).

---

## 🧩 Overview

The **Alt-Text Frontend** enables users to upload **Ebooks** (in **HTML** or **EPUB** format).  
Once uploaded, our servers analyze the Ebook and **automatically generate alt-text descriptions** for images that lack them.

Users can then use an intuitive **dashboard** to:
- View and manage both AI-generated and existing alt-texts  
- Edit or approve image descriptions  
- Collaborate in **groups**, where multiple users can edit and approve alt-texts within shared Ebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started

**(TBD — setup instructions coming soon)**

## 🌍 Our Mission

The **Alt-Text Project** is developed for the [Free Ebook Foundation](https://ebookfoundation.org/)  
as a **Senior Design Project** at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/).

As Ebooks continue to grow as a primary medium for reading, ensuring they are **accessible to everyone** becomes increasingly important.

**Alternative text (alt-text)** plays a vital role in accessibility — it allows visually impaired users relying on screen readers to understand images in Ebooks.  
However, many Ebooks still lack proper alt-text.

For instance, the [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/), which distributes over **70,000** public domain Ebooks, contains around **170,000 images without alt-text**.

**Our goal:**  
To leverage **AI, automation, and web technologies** to automatically generate meaningful image descriptions — closing the accessibility gap and enhancing Ebook collections like those of Project Gutenberg.
