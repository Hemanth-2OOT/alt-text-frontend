# Alt-Text-Frontend

A Next.js-based web application created to showcase the [Alt-Text PyPI Package](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/alt-text).

## Features

After creating an account, users can upload Ebooks (in either HTML or EPUB format).  
The system analyzes each Ebook and automatically generates alt-text descriptions for images that lack them.

Users can then access a dashboard to:
- View and edit both generated and existing alt-texts  
- Approve suggested descriptions  
- Collaborate within groups, where multiple members can edit and approve alt-texts for shared Ebooks  

## Getting Started

TBD

## Our Mission

The Alt-Text project is developed for the [Free Ebook Foundation](https://ebookfoundation.org/) as a Senior Design Project at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/).

As Ebooks become an increasingly popular way to consume written content, accessibility for all readers becomes even more important.  
Alternative text (alt-text) helps people who use screen readers—such as visually impaired users—understand the images in Ebooks.

Unfortunately, many Ebooks still lack proper alt-text.  
For example, the [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/), which distributes over 70,000 public domain Ebooks, contains approximately 170,000 images without alt-text.

The Alt-Text project's goal is to use AI, automation, and web technologies to automatically generate accurate and meaningful descriptions for images without alt-text—closing the accessibility gap and improving Ebook collections like those from Project Gutenberg.
